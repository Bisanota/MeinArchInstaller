# ArchInstaller
This is an ArchLinux Installer made for me (yeah, for personal uses only at the moment)

For download this files, use:


```
git clone https://github.com/Bisanota/MeinArchInstaller.git
```

Actually, every who wants to use it, are free to use it hahaha
~~Is for users who has installed before and knows what are doing~~
## What is this?

Is some files for a complete installation. Don't Worry
### First 2 files
Pre-Requisites: Do manual partitions and mount partitions.
- installerPartI.sh
- installerPartII.sh
This files are intended just for live iso of Arch. This are the instructions:
- [ ] Boot your live iso
- [ ] Connect to internet
- [ ] Just install git
- [ ] Mount your partition to /mnt
- [ ] Run ''installerPartI.sh''

### Post Installation
Run postInstaller.sh
Is intended for complete your installation
WARNING: INTERNET CONNECTION NEEDED EVERY MOMENT. DO NOT DARE DISCONNECT YOUR INTERNET >:(
- Here is also autoZRAMandSWAPFile.sh, that is just after complete the last step.

That is all?
------------
No. There are not all.
Actually, it may have an update someday (if I'd remember hahaha)

Enjoy the script :)


# PD: YEAH, I KNOW
ArchInstaller may do just this whole things, but, at least for me, causes errors always, specially on MBR disks (and I have an slow internet connections where I'm online :( )


## UPDATE 10/11/2025
I've retaken this project, so, to make this Arch installation replicable, free, and with instructions if anyone wants to use this manual
