# Mein Arch Installer
**By Bisanota**
This is an ArchLinux Installer made for me (yeah, for personal uses only at the moment)

For download/clone this files, use:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bisanota/MeinArchInstaller.git
```

Is planned to give a **Ready To Make** command in a near future.

Actually, every who wants to use it, are free to use it hahaha
~~Is for users who has installed before and knows what are doing~~
## What is this?

Is some files for a complete installation. Don't Worry
### First 2 files
Pre-Requisites: Do manual partitions and mount partitions.
- installerPartI.sh
- installerPartII.sh
This files are intended just for live iso of Arch. This are the instructions:
- [ ] Boot your live iso
- [ ] Connect to internet
- [ ] Just install git
- [ ] Mount your partition to /mnt
- [ ] Run ''installerPartI.sh''

### Post Installation
Run postInstaller.sh
Is intended for complete your installation
WARNING: INTERNET CONNECTION NEEDED EVERY MOMENT. DO NOT DARE DISCONNECT YOUR INTERNET >:(
- Here is also autoZRAMandSWAPFile.sh, that is just after complete the last step.

That is all?
------------
No. There are not all.
Actually, it may have an update someday (if I'd remember hahaha)

Enjoy the script :)

*This installer was planned for more easy installation, but an initial manual intervention with partitions and about mounting it*
